# Chad-Pool-Sample-Projects
An OpenGL Sample Project Demonstrating Normal Free lighting

Chad Pool WebGL sample Project

The following is a sample project that demonstrates the use of lighting without the use of an objects normal map.
The sample can be run in a webrowser by opening gl.html in google chrome.
The player can move using 'wasd' and can shoot projectiles using 'e' that colide with the rocks, destroying them.
'z' and 'x' may be used to move the camera up and down.
